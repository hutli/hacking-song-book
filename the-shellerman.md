## The Shellerman
### Verse[0]
There is a field within IT

The name of the field: security

No sense or form or ryme they own

Pwn my bully boys, pwn

### Cores
Soon we'll deploy the hack

To bring us shell and root and flag

One day when the CTF's done

We'll take our points and go

### Verse[1]
Hail linux; clear of any bloat

The shell does shine in unicode

The race kicks off, the hacking start

My setup falls apart

### Cores
Soon we'll deploy the hack

To bring us shell and root and flag

One day when the CTF's done

We'll take our points and go

### Verse[2]
We have not been two days in bed

Gone through all the internet

How do I map this memory,

with one bit-flip only?

### Cores
Soon we'll deploy the hack

To bring us shell and root and flag

One day when the CTF's done

We'll take our points and go

### Verse[3]
What happens when you smash a stack?

Can ROP-chains give me a shell back?

The answers may be classified

Come stay with us inside

### Cores
Soon we'll deploy the hack

To bring us shell and root and flag

One day when the CTF's done

We'll take our points and go

### Verse[-1]
So if your shell-code run on MIPS

a sexy curve is an ellipse

NOP-slide right in and join the show

Buy IDA License Pro

### More ideas:
the challenge's live for all the folk

now everything has broke

-------------------------

If zero-days you implement

Attacks clear channel assessment

-------------------------

So if you know what priv-esc is

What happens when you NOP-slide miss

-------------------------

So if you know stacksmashing well

How ropping gives you a root shell

-------------------------

If a good WAF you have deployed

You don't just throw on Metasploit
